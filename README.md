# **My Youtube**

This is a Youtube clone I created in order to learn more about HTML & CSS. It is a snapshot of the Home page of a user. I added videos from some of my favorite creators and others that showed up on _my_ Home feed. Clicking on a video takes you to the actual Youtube video. The website is responsive, so the window can be readjusted or used on mobile.
